Gothons Project

Project

* Create a .gitignore file
* HIGH PRIORITY: Why can’t the user move forward? All user input brings them back to the Central Corridor (Stage 1).

Styling

* Add a background image – same all pages
* Add a “cartoon” image to top right that changes room to room (This will take a bit of time to implement while we figure out the JS needed to do this.)
* Set a font theme
o Headers
* Change text color to RED when in a “Death State”
o Body Text

App.py

* Investigate possibility of bug in current lines 43-45, labeled “There is a bug here.” Spend no more than one hour in this investigation. Low priority, since everything works as-is.
* Review lines 36-38, as prompted by author “Why is this here?” Spend not more than one hour on this. Low priority, since the game works as-is.

Map.py

* Change current titling of rooms to “Stages” (Stage I, Stage II, etc.)
* Add logic to display the user’s choices in each situation. (Perhaps allow the user to input with radio buttons?)
* Need to set up randomizer for bomb “keypad” (Logic exists in original game for this)
* Need to import randomizer for safe escape pod from original game. (This version sets it to “2”.

Future Development to Explore
* Add content, rooms, outcomes
* Bring in the lexicon from the prior project, and use it to “parse” the user’s input.
* Change the styling (esp. background) for each room
